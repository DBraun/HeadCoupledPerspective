# Instructions:

Adjust the `scaling` variable in `index.html` according to your screens width in pixels and width in centimeters.

Start a python http server in this repo's directory:

```python
python -m http.server 8080
```

Visit `localhost:8080/index.html` in a web browser.

Maximize the screen, I forget how to do this.

In the GUI, the units are in centimeters. `(X,Y,Z)` Refers to the position of the center of your eyes relative to the center of the screen. Make `x` negative and move your head to the left while looking the screen. Make adjustments to `(X, Y, Z)` as necessary.
